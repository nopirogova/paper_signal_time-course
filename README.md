# Contrast Normalization Affects Response Time-Course of Visual Interneurons

Pirogova, N., and Borst, A.

## Abstract

In a natural environment, light intensities and visual contrasts vary widely, yet neurons only have a limited dynamic response range for encoding it. Neurons cope with that by flexibly adjusting their dynamic range to the statistics of the environment by a process called ‘contrast normalization’. The effect of contrast normalization is usually measured as a reduction of neural signal amplitudes, but whether it also influences response dynamics is not known. 
In this paper, we show that contrast normalization in visual interneurons of Drosophila melanogaster not only suppresses the amplitude but also alters the dynamics of the responses when a dynamic surround is present. We present a simple model that qualitatively reproduces the simultaneous effect of the visual surround on the amplitude and the temporal dynamics of the response by altering the cells’ input resistance and, thus, their membrane time constant. In conclusion, single-cell filtering properties as derived from artificial stimulus protocols like white-noise stimulation and reverse correlation cannot be transferred one-to-one to their responses under natural conditions.
